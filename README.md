This recipe project was curated by The Odin Project (TOP). 
This project was solely developed using vanilla HTML. Skills Demonstrated:
HTML Fundamentals: I have a solid understanding of HTML basics, including tags, attributes, and the structure of an HTML document.
Semantic HTML: I have used semantic HTML elements appropriately to structure the content of the recipe, making it more accessible and understandable to both humans and search engines.
Links and Anchors: I have created links to internal resources such as images and pages, to navigate within the recipe document.
Image Embedding: I have embedded images within the recipe to illustrate the appearance of the dish.
Version Control: I have demonstrated skills in managing and tracking changes to your codebase.
